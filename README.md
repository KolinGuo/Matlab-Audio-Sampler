## Group Members: 
  * Kolin Guo  
  * Noah Yu  
  * Agnes Li  

## Shortcoming:  
  * Loop Recording only supports samples of 44.1 kHz sample rate  
  * Warning messages about the precision of timers' "StartDelay" in Command Window when user clicks the pad in Loop Recording Mode
  * GUI resizing problem on different version of Matlab and/or different operating system  

## Sources:
  * Piano keyboard is designed by [Mark Frankosky](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21262-matlab-piano)  
  * Fourier Transform algorithm of the graphic equalizer comes from [oRbIt](http://blog.csdn.net/orbit/article/details/45485197)
